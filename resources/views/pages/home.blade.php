                We can't wait for you to join us in celebrating our marriage!  It is going to be a magical evening of love, drinking, dancing and eating.  For guests who are planning on staying the night in Asbury Park, please see the <a href="/accommodations" title="Accommodations">accommodations page</a> for information regarding our room block at The Berkeley as well as additional hotels/accommodations in the area.

                Important information regarding parking:

                <span class="bold">For guests staying at The Berkeley</span>
                The hotel has valet parking for a fee.  However, the valet lot is small and may be full by the time you check into your room.  If the lot is full or you do not wish to valet your car, see below for street parking information.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="bold">For guests not staying the night</span>
                The Berkeley does not have a parking lot for wedding guests, so the best place to park is on the street.  Street parking is relatively easy to find (especially in October) and is inexpensive.  The best way to pay for parking is to download the AsburyPARK App and pay from your phone.  You can also use the meters to pay for parking.  If you do not want to pay for parking you can park on any of the residential streets where paying to park is not required.  Additionall, there are a few parking lots near The Berkeley that are available for use for a fee.
