			<h3>Post-Wedding Bar Crawl</h3>
			<p>
				We're still hammering out the details, but we really want to do a bar crawl.  There are a ton of awesome bars and breweries in Asbury Park so it's a perfect place to have a mid-afternoon, post-wedding bar crawl.  We're also toying with the idea of having a themed bar crawl for the sole reason that me and Brian really enjoy themed events.  So stay the weekend and frolick around Asbury with us!
